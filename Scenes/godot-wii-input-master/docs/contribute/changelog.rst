Version 0.3 - 2025-09-01
------------------------
Note that there is a breaking change!

- ``GDWiimoteServer.connect_wiimotes()`` has been renamed to ``GDWiimoteServer.initialize_connection()``. It now also takes an optional bool to automate initial pairing via WiiPair on windows although this is currently still experimental and disabled by default.


Version 0.2 - 2025-07-26
------------------------

Note that there is a breaking change!

**Changed**

- ``WiimoteManager`` has been renamed to ``GDWiimoteServer``. It is now an engine singleton by default and does not rely on the user to designate it as an autoload.

Initial release.
