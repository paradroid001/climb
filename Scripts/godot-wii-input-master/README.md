## How to use 
Install the GDWiiInput extension from the Godot asset library from inside the Godot editor. If this does not work for some reason, you can directly grab a [release](https://github.com/20akshay00/godot-wii-input/releases) from this repository and unzip the `\addons` folder which must be placed in the root of your Godot project. 

**Note:** If you clone this repository to run the demo project, the addon must still be manually installed first through either of the methods mentioned above!

## Features

- **Button Input**: All button presses, including the Nunchuk joystick motion, are routed through Godot's Input system. (Check the demo project to see the mappings)
- **LED Control & Rumble Feedback**: Control the LED lights on the Wiimote and trigger rumble feedback.
- **IR Data**: Access the positions and sizes of upto 4 IR clusters detected by the IR camera.
- **Motion Control**: In addition to access to raw accelerometer and gyroscope data, there are also basic motion control processing utilities from [GamepadMotionHelpers](https://github.com/JibbSmart/GamepadMotionHelpers) (**currently not reliable!**).

## Limitations

- **Third-party accessories** cannot be reliably supported due to the non-standard initialization methods they use.

- **Controllers cannot be added/removed mid-session**. This includes Wiimotes and their extensions. Wiiuse assumes all devices are paired and connected at the start of the session, and unfortunately, adding or removing controllers afterward is not supported. While a solution exists using a direct HID layer, this is outside the scope of this project.
